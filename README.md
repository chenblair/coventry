An application that works towards elimating the phone screen in navigation. We use spatial audio to gently and intuitively guide people to their desired destination.

Specifically we use GPS, other sensors, and a Head Related Transfer Function to simulate sound being emitted from a specific latitude and longitude.

It's an Android app. Headphones or earbuds required. Destination can be selected from Maps.

Built with AndroidSDK, SuperpoweredSDK, and Google Maps.
